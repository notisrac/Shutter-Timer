# Camera shutter time tester
This is a shutter time tester for SLR cameras

## Components
 - laser diode (you can use an IR diode, just make sure to have a photodiode, that matches the wavelength)
 - photodiode
 - 1Kohm resistor
 - 10Kohm resistor
 - breadboard
 - helping hands
 - arduino uno
 - wires

## Using
1. Assemble the circuit
1. Place the led and the photodiode in the claws of the helping hands
1. Place the camera between the led and the photodiode, with the lens off, the back open, and the mirror down
1. Turn on the arduino
1. Set the shutter speed
1. Fire away
1. Repeat for all the speeds you want

## Original notes
This is a camera shutter timer for an arduino microcontroller with a laser emitter module and a laser sensor.  I made a medium-embarassing youtube video about it for non-programmers here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwOh3da_Y8s
